# Accident Hotspot Prediction – Frontend Prototype

## 📌 Overview
This project is a frontend prototype for an **Accident Hotspot Prediction System** aimed at identifying and visualizing high-risk road locations. The application presents accident-related insights through an interactive dashboard and map-based visualization to support better understanding of traffic safety patterns.

The system is designed as a **cost-free, scalable, and region-agnostic solution**, suitable for demonstration in hackathons and academic projects.
